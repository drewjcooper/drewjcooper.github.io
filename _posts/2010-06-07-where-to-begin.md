So the first thing to do when learning a new language is obviously to
find some reference materials. In this post I'll look at C#
references.  I'll leave .NET to later, when we start to get into it.

[]{#more}

C# was created by Microsoft so the logical first place to go would be
the [MSDN
Library](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kx37x362.aspx).  As
typical in MSDN there's a full reference, including tutorials and the
[language
specification](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=dfbf523c-f98c-4804-afbd-459e846b268e&displaylang=en).

A quick Google search turns up a large number of on-line tutorials and
reference cards, a few of which are:

-   [C# Station tutorial](http://www.csharp-station.com/Tutorial.aspx)
-   [Softsteel Solutions C#
    tutorial](http://www.softsteel.co.uk/tutorials/cSharp/cIndex.html)
-   FunctionX has tutorials for each version of the C# language to
    date: [1.0](http://www.functionx.com/csharp1/index.htm),
    [2.0](http://www.functionx.com/csharp2/index.htm),
    [3.0](http://www.functionx.com/csharp/index.htm) and
    [4.0](http://www.csharpkey.com/csharp/index.htm)
-   [C# Basics Reference
    Sheet](http://www.dreamincode.net/downloads/ref_sheets/csharp_basics_reference_sheet.pdf)
    from \</dream-in-code\>
-   [Core C# and .NET Quick
    Reference](http://www.digilife.be/quickreferences/QRC/Core%20CSharp%20and%20.NET%20Quick%20Reference.pdf)
-   [C# Syntax Reference
    Card](http://www.csharpfriends.com/articles/getarticle.aspx?articleid=16)

I'll link some of these in the side-bar as I use them.

As well as a language reference it's also a good idea to have an idea of
how you want to learn.  For me, I learn best by doing.  A month-or-so
ago I heard, I can't remember where, about a blog post detailing the [15
exercises](http://www.jobsnake.com/seek/articles/index.cgi?openarticle&8533)
the author went through in learning a new language.  In searching for
this post last week I also found [a series of follow-up
posts](http://www.knowing.net/index.php/2006/06/16/15-exercises-to-know-a-programming-language-part-1/)
by another programmer with some more advanced exercises.

So I figured it would be a good idea to work through these exercises
myself, and document it all here.  As I complete each exercise I'll blog
about it, including the code, and highlighting the aspects of the
language learned in the exercise.

I also have an idea or two for a couple of actual projects that I'd like
to complete, but more about that later.

Next time I'll be getting started on actual code.
