So the first thing to do when learning a new language is obviously to find some
reference materials. In this post I'll look at C# references.  I'll leave .NET
to later, when we start to get into it.
<!--more-->

C# was created by Microsoft so the logical first place to go would be
the [MSDN
Library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kx37x362.aspx).  As
typical in MSDN there's a full reference, including tutorials and the
[language
specification](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=dfbf523c-f98c-4804-afbd-459e846b268e&displaylang=en).

A quick Google search turns up a large number of on-line tutorials and
reference cards, a few of which are:

- [C# Station tutorial](https://csharp-station.com/Tutorial/CSharp/SmartConsoleSetup.aspx)
- FunctionX has tutorials for each version of the C# language to date:
  [1.0](http://www.functionx.com/csharp1/index.htm),
  [2.0](http://www.functionx.com/csharp2/index.htm),
  [3.0](http://www.functionx.com/csharp3/index.htm) and
  [4.0](http://www.functionx.com/csharp40/index.htm)
- [C# Basics Reference Sheet](https://www.dreamincode.net/downloads/ref_sheets/csharp_basics_reference_sheet.pdf)
  from </dream.in.code>

I'll link some of these in the side-bar as I use them.

As well as a language reference it's also a good idea to have an idea of how you
want to learn.  For me, I learn best by doing.  A month-or-so ago I heard, I
can't remember where, about a blog post detailing the [15
exercises](https://www.articlecity.com/articles/computers_and_internet/article_2686.shtml) the
author went through in learning a new language.

So I figured it would be a good idea to work through these exercises myself, and
document it all here.  As I complete each exercise I'll blog about it, including
the code, and highlighting the aspects of the language learned in the exercise.

I also have an idea or two for a couple of actual projects that I'd like to
complete, but more about that later.

Next time I'll be getting started on actual code.
