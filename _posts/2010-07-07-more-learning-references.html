<p>As I’ve been working on learning C# and .NET in the last couple of weeks,
I’ve come across a number of useful references beyond the tutorials and other
things I list in <a
href="http://learningcsharpnet.blogspot.com/2010/06/where-to-begin.html"
target="_blank">my second post</a>.&#160; They range from books, to posters, to
podcasts, and I’ll briefly look at them in this post.</p> <a name='more'></a>
<h3></h3>  <h3>Class Library references and posters</h3>  <p>MSDN has a very
complete reference of the <a
href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229335.aspx">.NET Framework
Class Library</a>, but, given the shear number of namespaces and classes in the
framework, it’s difficult to just browse and find something that looks like what
you’re looking for.&#160; What I want is a basic reference, preferably a PDF
that I can print, that lists the namespace hierarchy, along with the classes,
structs and other types in each namespace, and a brief description of
each.&#160; In my hunt for such a reference I came across a couple of posters
illustrating portions of the .NET class library:</p>  <ul>   <li>The <a
href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2008/01/12/net-framework-3-5-namespace-poster-updated.aspx">.NET
Framework 3.5 Namespace poster</a>, as the name suggests, shows the commonly
used namespaces and types in the 3.5 version of the .NET framework. </li>
<li>The <a
href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdownload.microsoft.com%2Fdownload%2FE%2F6%2FA%2FE6A8A715-7695-493C-8CFA-8E0C23A4BE1D%2F098-115952-NETFX4-Poster.pdf&amp;ei=MBI0TLLAAsaDngez6pSyAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFzWf6p8KzY6MHfS-JhisVO-YjD-A&amp;sig2=nMzNah_zWhTGM2sXTjdiuQ"
target="_blank">.NET Framework 4 and Extensions</a> poster shows the namespaces
and types that are new in 4.0.</li> </ul>  <p>There was another poster I found
of the new stuff in version 4.0 which I downloaded and printed, but now that I
come to write about it I can’t seem to find it again to link to, and the file
seems to have disappeared from my disk.&#160; Weird.</p>  <p>Anyway, these
posters weren’t exactly what I was looking for.&#160; If anyone knows of a
reference such as I’ve described above, please let me know.&#160; Failing that I
may have to put my growing C# skills to the test by writing a small program to
parse the HTML of the MSDN Library and produce the reference myself.</p>
<h3>Coding style guidelines</h3>  <p>Given that the programming I have done over
the last 10 years or so has been fairly ad-hoc, and in a range of languages, I
felt a bit out-of-touch with current thinking regarding coding style.&#160; MSDN
has some guidelines, but they’re mostly around naming conventions.&#160; I
wanted to find something a bit more comprehensive.&#160; I found a few blog
posts that talked about various aspects of coding style, but then I came across
Lance Hunt’s <a
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/lhunt/pages/CSharp-Coding-Standards-document.aspx">C#
Coding Standards for .NET</a>.&#160; In Lance’s words:</p>  <blockquote>
<p>There have been numerous attempts to document C# Coding Standards since the
language was released, but most are either overly verbose, too restrictive, or
try to cover every single scenario.&#160; This is my attempt to start from
scratch and write a new standards document that is concise, simple to read &amp;
use, and creates a pragmatic balance of rule enforcement.&#160; Having said
that, I'm sure that many of you will have just as many disagreements with this
document as I have with others, but I am always up for a good debate.</p>
</blockquote>  <p>The document is only 20 or so pages long and is a good,
concise style reference.&#160; I’m not going to be following it religiously, but
I will use it as a guide as I write my code. </p>  <h3>Blogs, forums and
podcasts</h3>  <p>I’ve also looked around for resources I can use to keep up on
developments in the .NET universe, and also communities where questions can be
answered, etc.&#160; I don’t really have the time for reading too many blogs,
but I do get time to listen to podcasts, and to that end I found two that I’m
now listening to:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://hanselminutes.com"
target="_blank">Hanselminutes</a> is a weekly audio talk show with noted web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman and hosted by Carl Franklin. Scott
discusses utilities and tools, gives practical how-to advice, and discusses
ASP.NET or Windows issues and workarounds. </li>    <li><a
href="http://dotnetrocks.com" target="_blank">.NET Rocks!</a> is a weekly talk
show for anyone interested in programming on the Microsoft .NET platform. The
shows range from introductory information to hardcore geekiness. </li> </ul>
<p>In my search for resources a few forum sites kept popping up in my Google
searches.&#160; The ones that really annoy me are the ones that make the
questions freely viewable, but then want to charge you a subscription to see the
answers.&#160; A great alternative is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack
Overflow</a>, a free programming Q &amp; A site – lots of questions and
quick-response answers on just about any language/platform you can think of.</p>
<h3>Books</h3>  <p>Last, but definitely not least, in this list of
newly-discovered resources, is a book that I found through listening to
Hanselminutes – <a href="http://charlespetzold.com/dotnet/index.html">.NET Book
Zero by Charles Petzold</a>.&#160; Yes, it’s *that* Charles Petzold, the one
whose other book (one of many) taught me Windows 3.1 programming back in
Uni.&#160; This book is a great introduction to C# and .NET, and the best bit is
… it’s free!</p>  <p>I think that will do for this post.&#160; I’ll put links to
some of these resources in the side bar.&#160; Next post we’ll get back to some
code.&#160; See you then.</p>
