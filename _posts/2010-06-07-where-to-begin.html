<p>So the first thing to do when learning a new language is obviously to find some reference materials. In this post I’ll look at C# references.&#160; I’ll leave .NET to later, when we start to get into it.</p> <a name='more'></a>  <p>C# was created by Microsoft so the logical first place to go would be the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kx37x362.aspx">MSDN Library</a>.&#160; As typical in MSDN there’s a full reference, including tutorials and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=dfbf523c-f98c-4804-afbd-459e846b268e&amp;displaylang=en">language specification</a>.</p>  <p>A quick Google search turns up a large number of on-line tutorials and reference cards, a few of which are:</p>  <ul>   <li><a href="http://www.csharp-station.com/Tutorial.aspx">C# Station tutorial</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://www.softsteel.co.uk/tutorials/cSharp/cIndex.html">Softsteel Solutions C# tutorial</a> </li>    <li>FunctionX has tutorials for each version of the C# language to date: <a href="http://www.functionx.com/csharp1/index.htm">1.0</a>, <a href="http://www.functionx.com/csharp2/index.htm">2.0</a>, <a href="http://www.functionx.com/csharp/index.htm">3.0</a> and <a href="http://www.csharpkey.com/csharp/index.htm">4.0</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://www.dreamincode.net/downloads/ref_sheets/csharp_basics_reference_sheet.pdf">C# Basics Reference Sheet</a> from &lt;/dream-in-code&gt; </li>    <li><a href="http://www.digilife.be/quickreferences/QRC/Core%20CSharp%20and%20.NET%20Quick%20Reference.pdf">Core C# and .NET Quick Reference</a> </li>    <li><a href="http://www.csharpfriends.com/articles/getarticle.aspx?articleid=16">C# Syntax Reference Card</a> </li> </ul>  <p>I’ll link some of these in the side-bar as I use them.</p>  <p>As well as a language reference it’s also a good idea to have an idea of how you want to learn.&#160; For me, I learn best by doing.&#160; A month-or-so ago I heard, I can’t remember where, about a blog post detailing the <a href="http://www.jobsnake.com/seek/articles/index.cgi?openarticle&amp;8533">15 exercises</a> the author went through in learning a new language.&#160; In searching for this post last week I also found <a href="http://www.knowing.net/index.php/2006/06/16/15-exercises-to-know-a-programming-language-part-1/">a series of follow-up posts</a> by another programmer with some more advanced exercises.</p>  <p>So I figured it would be a good idea to work through these exercises myself, and document it all here.&#160; As I complete each exercise I’ll blog about it, including the code, and highlighting the aspects of the language learned in the exercise.</p>  <p>I also have an idea or two for a couple of actual projects that I’d like to complete, but more about that later.</p>  <p>Next time I’ll be getting started on actual code.</p>
