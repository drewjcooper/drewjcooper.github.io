So, you may have noticed that it's been about 6 months since my last
post.  I've been a little busy.  I've also been learning heaps.
<!--more-->

Since my last post I've had a couple of opportunities to use my new-found
C#/.Net skills at work. Since early December I've been neck-deep in ASP.Net MVC,
working on a new web-based workflow application to streamline my company's
recruitment process. I've been having a lot of fun learning about MVC (I'd
previously only worked with ASP classic in VB) including writing custom model
binders and HTML helpers (more on those in future posts).  I've also delved into
Entity Framework, and then ended up in nHibernate because we run Oracle
databases on the back-end.

I feel like I'm starting to get my head around this whole .NET universe, and
I've been helped a lot along the way a couple of must-listen podcasts - [.NET
Rocks!](https://dotnetrocks.com) and [Hanselminutes](https://hanselminutes.com).
Every week listening to these two great shows I've discovered tools to make the
development process easier, or been exposed to technologies that I wouldn't have
otherwise known about.

So, where to now?  Well, I've lost my desire to finish the series on programming
exercises that I've been working through.  I've got a bunch of ideas for posts
based on things that I've been learning at work. These will necessarily be more
technical than my posts to date, but I hope that newer programmers will still
find them useful, even if it's just to get a feel for the sort of stuff that's
possible.  I've also got an idea for a little project I'd like to pursue, which
I will probably end up open-sourcing, and that will probably provide plenty of
topics for new posts.

Having said that, my last post was the second of a 4 or 5 post series covering
my solution to the problem of developing a scientific calculator.  I don't
really want to leave that hanging so I'll finish the series off before I take
this blog in new directions.  And who knows, there may be times in the future
when I'm running low on inspiration, and I'll come back to these exercises just
for fun.
