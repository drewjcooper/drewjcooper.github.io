For anybody who's actually been reading and is interested I've uploaded
a ZIP file containing the Visual Studio project with all the code from
the blog so far.  I'll aim to keep it up to date with future code on a
semi-regular basis.

Anyway, if you want it you can get it
[here](https://cid-97e883c7c0771625.office.live.com/self.aspx/Blog%20Files/LearningCSharp-15Exercises.zip#resId/97E883C7C0771625!2117
"Link to code download").
