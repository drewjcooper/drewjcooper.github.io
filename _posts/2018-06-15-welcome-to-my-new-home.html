<p>My first foray into blogging was 8 years ago, in 2010, when I was <a href="https://learningcsharpnet.blogspot.com/">learning C# and .Net</a> for the first time.&nbsp; At the time I decided to blog about what I was learning as a way to help make things stick. Not only was I learning a new language and platform, but, as a result of my own personal <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/hitrefresh/">"Hit Refresh"</a> moment, I was learning a new discipline as I changed gears in my career from IT operations to software engineering.</p><p>That blog experience lasted for a year before I ran out of steam for a bit. I stopped blogging due to a mix of shifting personal priorities, a (un)healthy dose of <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx">imposter syndrome</a>, and a progression in the complexity of the stuff I was learning. Part of it, too, was that I was getting opportunities at work to exercise and grow my software engineering skills on real projects, so my initial reason for blogging wasn’t such a need anymore.</p><p>Fast forward 2 years and I had somehow I managed to talk my way into a job at Microsoft, which meant relocating my family to Redmond. The five years since have been an amazing ride.&nbsp; I’ve worked with some great people and learned a lot about <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">my craft</a>. We had a great experience living the USA for nearly 5 years and got to see a good chunk of the country.</p><p>At the start of this year we moved back to Australia for personal reasons, and I started working for WiseTech Global, a Sydney company developing software for the global logistics industry. I’ve been learning a bunch of platforms and frameworks that I hadn’t used before, and that got my blogging juices flowing again.</p><p>So, here I am, back in the saddle as it were, writing up stuff that’s on my mind, that I don’t want to forget, or that I think is cool and want to share with others.&nbsp; I can’t promise it’ll be super entertaining or regular, but I’m back to give it ago.&nbsp; Let’s see what happens…</p>
