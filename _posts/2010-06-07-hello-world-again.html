<p>In <a href="http://www.jobsnake.com/seek/articles/index.cgi?openarticle&amp;8533" target="_blank">15 Exercises for Learning a new Programming Language</a>, Prashant Mhatre kicks off with:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>First of all, get familiar with Compiler, compiler option, editor shortcuts or integrated development environment (IDE). Start with a simple ‘Hello World’ program. Compile it. Use basic functionalities of debugger like setting break points, printing variable values, moving to the next or specific position, stopping debugger etc.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Let’s jump straight into the code first.</p> <a name='more'></a>  <p><span id="more-47"></span></p>  <p>Here’s the most basic “Hello World” in C#:</p>  <pre class="csharpcode"><span class="kwrd">class</span> MainClass
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>);
    }
}</pre>

<p>This looks a little different to the way it’s presented in most tutorials, but I’ll get to that in a minute.</p>

<p>The first thing to notice here is the <strong>MainClass</strong> class.&#160; In general terms, the only things that can be at the global level of a C# source file are certain type declarations, namespace and alias declarations, and using-namespace-directives.&#160; This means that the entry point of the program (the <strong>main()</strong> function in C) must actually be a method of a class.&#160; The name of the <strong>class</strong> here is not important.&#160; </p>

<p>The <strong>Main()</strong> method must be a <strong>static</strong> member.&#160; A static member operates without reference to a specific class instance, and exists independent of class instantiation.&#160; More on this at a later time.</p>

<p>The <strong>Main()</strong> method, like in C, can be declared to return <strong>void</strong> or <strong>int</strong>, and may take command-line arguments as an array of strings, like this:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode"><span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">int</span> Main(<span class="kwrd">string</span>[] args) { ... }</pre>

<p>The last thing to notice about “Hello World” is the line that does the actual work. In this line, <strong>WriteLine</strong> is a method of the <strong>Console</strong> class which is a member of the <strong>System</strong> namespace.&#160; In C#, classes, and other types, are organised into a namespace hierarchy.&#160; In the code above the <strong>MainClass</strong> class is in the global namespace.&#160; A program is able to declare its own namespaces.</p>

<p>The other thing we can do is tell the compiler which namespaces we want to use the members of, with a <strong>using</strong> directive.&#160; So “Hello World” can also be written:</p>

<pre class="csharpcode"><span class="kwrd">using</span> System;

<span class="kwrd">class</span> MainClass
{
    <span class="kwrd">static</span> <span class="kwrd">void</span> Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(<span class="str">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>);
    }
}</pre>

<p>This is the form usually seen in C# tutorials.&#160; The first line says that we want to be able to use the members of the System namespace without using the fully qualified name.&#160; Thus, in the program we are now able to use the <strong>Console</strong> class directly.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve got some code we need a compiler so we can turn it into an executable program.&#160; The .NET framework provides a C# compiler called <strong>csc.exe</strong>.&#160; On my computer with version 4.0 of the .NET framework, the compiler is at C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\csc.exe.&#160; I added the folder to my PATH to make things easier.</p>

<p>Save the above code in a file called <strong>HelloWorld.cs</strong> and then do:</p>

<pre class="console">csc.exe HelloWorld.cs</pre>

<p>This will create HelloWorld.exe which will write the familiar greeting to the console.&#160; “csc.exe /?” will give the list of options available when running the compiler.</p>

<p>Of course, an easier way to do things is to use an IDE, and for the price (free) you really can’t go past <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/" target="_blank">Microsoft Visual C# Express</a>.&#160; I won’t go into all the options and debugging methods here – I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader.&#160; Suffice to say that if you’re at all familiar with Microsoft’s Visual Studio family of products you’ll be right at home.</p>

<p>I think that will do it for this time.&#160; In the next post we’ll tackle Prashant’s first exercise.</p>
