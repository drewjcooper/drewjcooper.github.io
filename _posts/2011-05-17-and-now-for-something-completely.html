<p>And now for something completely different … a man with three buttocks … okay, so maybe not THAT different.</p><p>It’s not C# or .Net, though.&nbsp; It is, however, something that many ASP.Net developers will run across – jQuery.</p><p>Long story short – I’ve created a new jQuery cheat sheet in two versions (<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=97E883C7C0771625%212115" target="_blank">A4</a> and <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=97E883C7C0771625%212116" target="_blank">Letter</a>).&nbsp; If you want the long story, read on.&nbsp; If you don’t then just grab your copy and let me know if you find it helpful.</p><a name='more'></a> <p><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 5px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" align="right" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_8osJtRBSdMg/TdFvE5a8MVI/AAAAAAAAARk/Vc1Q95STg1o/image%5B6%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="328" height="263">12 months ago I’d never heard of jQuery, and then I started seeing bits and pieces about it in posts on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>.&nbsp; Then when I started working on the ASP.Net MVC application at work, the one I’ve mentioned previously, I found myself looking around for a good UI framework and, lo and behold, there was <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery: The Write Less, Do More, JavaScript Library</a>.</p><p>For those of you who don’t know, jQuery is a Javascript framework, written in Javascript, that runs in the browser and makes in insanely easy to manipulate the HTML DOM, and create all sorts of cool UI effects, Ajax interactions, and heaps more.&nbsp; </p><p>As I write this, jQuery version 1.6 is in beta, and it’s big.&nbsp; There are somewhere in the vicinity of 500 property and method signatures, which begs the question, “how do I find out what I can do with this thing?”.</p><p>Well, there’s the excellent on-line <a href="http://api.jquery.com">jQuery API</a> documentation, which is also available in a <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-1-4-reference-guide/book" target="_blank">dead-tree version</a> (albeit for version 1.4), but it’s not free, and is a bit more than I was looking for.</p><p>Of course, what every competent developer really needs is a quick reference, or Cheat Sheet, to quickly get an idea of what operations are available, or to just get a reminder of the arguments for a specific method call.&nbsp; A quick look on Google turns up quite a number of cheat sheets of various kinds.&nbsp; The newest one I found is the excellent <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/55305532/jQuery-1-6-Visual-Cheat-Sheet" target="_blank">jQuery Visual Cheat Sheet</a> designed by Antonio Lupetti.&nbsp; Antonio’s done a great job with this sheet, which he appears to have first created for jQuery 1.3, and has updated for each version of jQuery since.&nbsp; </p><p>As good as the Visual Cheat Sheet is, it’s not quite what I was looking for.&nbsp; For starters it’s four pages long, and I was hoping for something I could print on a single sheet of paper.&nbsp; I was also hoping for something that had some indication of the jQuery version in which the various methods and properties were introduced.</p><p>At the same time I was looking for cheat sheets, I discovered that the jQuery API docs are available as a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/api" target="_blank">raw XML dump</a>.&nbsp; So I grabbed a copy and, inspired by <a href="http://www.gscottolson.com/jquery/jQuery1.2.cheatsheet.v1.0.pdf" target="_blank">G. Scott Olson's jQuery 1.2 Cheat Sheet</a>, I set to writing an XSL stylesheet to turn it into something readable.&nbsp; My goal was to create a simple cheat sheet that would suit my needs, and that I could quickly update for future jQuery versions.&nbsp; The XSL I came up with produces a chunk of HTML, which I then copied into MS Word and tweaked the formatting.</p><p>The result is a two-page cheat sheet that can be printed double-sided on a single sheet of paper, and lists every method, property, selector and template tag signature in the XML documentation.&nbsp; For each signature it also lists the return-type and the jQuery version in which it first appeared.&nbsp; Assuming no major structural changes, I can produce a cheat sheet from a new version of the XML in about 10 minutes.&nbsp; </p><p>Now I’m happy, and I want to share my happiness with you.&nbsp; I’m making the cheat sheet available to anyone who’d like to use it.&nbsp; I’ve created two versions – one for <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=97E883C7C0771625%212115" target="_blank">A4 paper</a> and one for <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=97E883C7C0771625%212116" target="_blank">Letter</a>.&nbsp; Both have exactly the same information.&nbsp; Grab the one that suits your printer.&nbsp; And please, let me know if you find it useful, or you notice any glaring omissions or errors.&nbsp; Any suggestions for improvements would also be welcome.</p><p>I would like to, at some stage, build on my XSL to create a jQuery eBook containing a fuller reference with examples from the XML documentation, but I have a few other things on my pate before I get to that.&nbsp; It would also be really cool to look at Microsoft’s XML document formats so the stylesheet could produce a native Word document that needs minimal tweaking.&nbsp; There’s always something else to learn but, hey, that’s what makes life interesting.</p>
