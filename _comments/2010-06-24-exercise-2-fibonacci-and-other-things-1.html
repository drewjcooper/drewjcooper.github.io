Nice work!<br /><br />You could also look at using LINQ to get the Min / Max - http://www.hookedonlinq.com/MaxOperator.ashx .<br /><br />I don&#39;t think the standard LINQ Min / Max will handle an IEnumerable with Count == 0, but then again neither will your current code...<br /><br />Also, you might find this link of interest: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229043.aspx .
